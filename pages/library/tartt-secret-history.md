So, let's see how it starts. Well, the book begins with a prologue, always an interesting place to kick off.

> The snow in the mountains was melting and Bunny had been dead for several weeks before we came to understand the gravity of our situation. He'd been dead for ten days before they found him, you know.
> *pg. 1*{.small}
> {.bq-alt}

A death, before we've even picked it up?

What are you doing, Donna? Really, how can you do that? A story, before the actual story. What are you doing?

Oh my.

Now I want to know.

Who is Bunny? And what kind of a name is that? Is that an actual bunny rabbit, called Bunny, weirdly? Or is it the name of a real human person?

The next few sentences tell us — there's a huge manhunt, involving police and FBI, but snow falls after the death and covers the body where it lies at the bottom of a ravine, and there's footsteps in the mud leading down there. And then we discover the story's in the first person, and the narrator says they're partly to blame for the death – and we're not even off the first page!

Woah.

Have mercy on us, Donna Tartt. So much to take on board already.

The prologue is only two pages long, and you don't ease up on the 2nd page. What? What, Donna?

The narrator breezes through the search party, but also seems to understand that walking away is a wholly different thing. And, before leaving us, suggests that maybe it was actually a conspiracy, and that such horrors continue their haunting. So it ends, this brusque two-page prologue:

> I suppose at one time in my life I might have had any number of stories, but now there is no other. This is the only story I well ever be able to tell.
> *pg. 2*{.small}
> {.bq-alt}

Well, yes.

No surprise there. Coz it's already so chilling, so terrible, and you've made sure I'm in on the secret — and I'm totally and utterly hooked.

The story is told in two parts — Book I, and Book II — roughly the same size, and it's quickly clear that Book I has fallen back in time from the world of the prologue. Sort of. We read and we discover that the narrator is a man called Richard Papen who, at the age of twenty-eight, is telling us his story as a kind of confession.

> Does such a thing as 'the fatal flaw,' that shadowy dark crack running down the middle of a life, exist outside of literature? I used to think it didn't. Now I think it does. And I think that mine is this: a morbid longing for the picturesque at all costs.
> *pg. 5*{.small}
> {.bq-alt}

So begins Richard's unburdening.

He takes us back to his time at Hampden College, a dusty institution in rural Vermont where Richard has landed almost by accident and via Financial Aid, and to his friends there. Bunny appears again quickly, as soon as pg. 7, amongst his other classmates — an exclusive club of wealthy friends, amongst whom Richard, feels forever an interloper.

The reader realises quickly that Book I is going to take us to his terrible death.

That makes *The Secret History* already two things — a murder mystery thriller, and a campus coming-of-age story. But there's one more — it's also a modern-day Greek tragedy.

Richard, Bunny, and their classmates all study classics together, particularly the Greeks, and [Euripides' story of *The Bacchae*](https://chs.harvard.edu/primary-source/euripides-bacchae-sb/){target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"} has a shaping hand on the plot of Donna Tartt's novel. The climax of *The Bacchae* has the strongest echo — King Pentheus of Thebes has rejected Dionysus, god of wine and religious ecstasy, and his whole cult, and in punishment the god lures him to the mountains, where he is torn apart by the frenzied Maenads — but there are lots of other classical themes throughout, for those sensitive to them.

That's no barrier to enjoying the story, though. Book I pulses with Bacchanalian sensibilities where 'beauty is terror' (pg.41), and the 'violence and savagery' (pg. 42) of the *Bacchae* feel as if they're pulling us towards the inevitable. But Tartt is so skilled an writer you can rest in the strength of her deep knowledge and just follow her in the story.

Book II takes us into the terrible aftermath of Bunny's death — the early searches and the group's attempts to maintain their camouflage, then the strains and fractures that appear, their fears, their recriminations, their dispersal, and the ultimate outcomes.
