So, let's check out how it starts. Well, the book begins with a prologue, always an interesting place to kick off.

> The snow in the mountains was melting and Bunny had been dead for several weeks before we came to understand the gravity of our situation. He'd been dead for ten days before they found him, you know.
> {.bq-alt}

Oh my. A death, before we've even picked it up. What are you doing, Donna? Really, how can you do that? A story, before the actual story. What are you doing?

Now I want to know. Who is Bunny? And what kind of a name is that? Is that an actual bunny rabbit, called Bunny, weirdly? Or is it the name of a real human person? The next few sentences tell us — there's a huge manhunt, involving police and FBI, but snow falls after the death and covers the body where it lies at the bottom of a ravine, and there's footsteps in the mud leading down there. And then we discover it's a story in the first person, and the narrator says they are partly to blame for the death – and we're not even off the first page!

Woah.
