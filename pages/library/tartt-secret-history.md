So, let's see how it starts. Well, the book begins with a prologue, always an interesting place to kick off.

> The snow in the mountains was melting and Bunny had been dead for several weeks before we came to understand the gravity of our situation. He'd been dead for ten days before they found him, you know.
> *pg. 1*{.small}
> {.bq-alt}

Oh my. A death, before we've even picked it up. What are you doing, Donna? Really, how can you do that? A story, before the actual story. What are you doing?

Now I want to know. Who is Bunny? And what kind of a name is that? Is that an actual bunny rabbit, called Bunny, weirdly? Or is it the name of a real human person? The next few sentences tell us — there's a huge manhunt, involving police and FBI, but snow falls after the death and covers the body where it lies at the bottom of a ravine, and there's footsteps in the mud leading down there. And then we discover the story's in the first person, and the narrator says they're partly to blame for the death – and we're not even off the first page!

Woah.

Have mercy on us, Donna Tartt. So much to take on board already.

The prologue is only two pages long, and you don't let up on the 2nd page. What?

The narrator breezes through the search party, but also seems to understand that walking away is a wholly different thing. And, before leaving us, suggests that maybe it was actually a conspiracy, and that such horrors continue their haunting. So it ends, this brusque two-page prologue:

> I suppose at one time in my life I might have had any number of stories, but now there is no other. This is the only story I well ever be able to tell.
> *pg. 2*{.small}
> {.bq-alt}

Well, yes.

No surprise there. Coz it's already so bonkers that I am totally and utterly hooked.

The story is told in two parts — Book I, and Book II — roughly the same size, and it's quickly clear that Book I has fallen back in time from the world of the prologue. Sort of. We read and we discover that the narrator is a man called Richard Papen, at the age of twenty-eight telling us his story
