How can you do it, John Williams? It's just not right. You open this novel, and in the first paragraph you tell us everything. You give is our character, William Stoner. You tell us his whole life in one sentence. And in the end, he's barely remembered by his colleagues. That's all there is to him.

What? How can you do that? How can you start one of the most celebrated classic stories like that?

- First sentence:
  - Stoner goes to university, aged 19.
- Second:
  - He gets his PhD 8 years later, at the height of World War 1
  - … and works at the university until his death.
- Third:
  - He was never really promoted.
  - Few students remembered him.
- Fourth:
  - He dies.
  - And he's memorialised with a rare manuscript.

That's it.

Paragraph two does the summary even more briskly:

> An occasional student who comes upon the name may remember idly who William Stoner was, but he seldom pursues his curiosity beyond a casual question.
> {.bq-alt}

A completely unremarkable man who is the profound beating heart of one of the best novels of the 20th Century.

What? Come on now, Mr Williams.

William Stoner is a wholly different main character. He is neither a hero nor a villain, he's just a very ordinary man, entirely human. He tries to lead a good life, a life of sincerity and integrity without needing to set the world aflame, that's all.

He is just a simple man, and that's at the core of what makes this such an exceptional book.

William Stoner's life is ordinary, and that is exactly what allows us as readers to glimpse what it means to be decent and show us how to find meaning for ourselves. Even in difficulties, even in disappointments, Stoner shows us how to see beauty.

Stoner grows up a farming son in rural Missouri. His father encourages him to go to the state university, to study agriculture. At university, though, he takes an English course and encounters Shakespeare's famous [Sonnet 73](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45099/sonnet-73-that-time-of-year-thou-mayst-in-me-behold){target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"} about aging. He falls in love with literature and transfers to the humanities.

Two of Stoner's student friends, Masters and Finch, enlist and go off to fight in World War I, but he stays behind to teach at the faculty. Eventually he gains his doctorate, the war ends, but it has taken Masters and only Finch returns.

He falls in love with Edith, and despite her initial coldness they marry. They have a daughter, Grace, but Edith is bedridden for a year afterward and soon realises motherhood doesn't make her happy. Their marriage is increasingly strained, she leaves raising their daughter to him. Edit mistreats him, and Stoner realises she is manipulating things to drive a wedge between father and daughter.

Stoner's work-life has its strains, including a long feud with the man who eventually becomes departmental Chair, Lomax. Later in life, Stoner has a happy affair with Katherine, a PhD student. Lomax discovers it and makes threats to them both. Painfully, they separate, and eventually Katherine leaves the department.

In later life, Stoner is a departmental legend, a respected teacher. He prepares for retirement and wants to complete a few last years, but Lomax tries to push him out early. Stoner discovers cancer, his symptoms worsen and force him to leave. His final years are filled with extreme pain from the disease, but he reflects on whether he could have done more, he has regrets but he also accepts that he has done his best.

It takes a very special kind of writer to lend us a character such as Stoner.

He is no Jack Reacher, he's no George Smiley. He is an ordinary man.
