Well, Douglas Coupland's *Microserfs* — it's a groundbreaking novel about a particular period in time, but it's kinda disappeared into history. So, what's it like reading it today?

Beginning at Chapter 1:

> **FRIDAY, Early Fall, 1993**{.h3-style .secondary-font}
> {.margin-block-end-nil}
>
> This morning, just after 11:00, Michael locked himself in his office and he won't come out.
> {.margin-block-start-nil}
> {.bq-alt}

Stop it, [Douglas Coupland](https://coupland.com/){target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"}, just stop it.

Getting us hooked in just one sentence. Stop it, now.

> Bill (Bill!) sent Michael this totally wicked flame-mail from hell on the email system — and he just wailed on a chunk of code Michael had written.
> {.bq-alt}

Oh, come on. You're referencing Bill Gates? That Bill? So you're setting this in the real world? With actual people in reality as people in the novel?

> We figured it must have been a random quality check to keep the troops in line. Bill's so smart.
> &nbsp; Bill is wise.
> &nbsp; Bill is kind.
> &nbsp; Bill is benevolent.
> &nbsp; Bill, Be My Friend … *Please!*
> {.bq-alt}

Actual Mr B. Gates? Come on now.

*Microserfs* is written as a diary by Daniel, a software tester at Microsoft (yes, that's right — actual Microsoft!), 'to try to see the patterns in my life' *(pg. 4)*{.small}. So this book is not just a [roman à clef](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/what-is-a-roman-a-clef){target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"}, with fictitious names swapped for real people and places — you're going ahead and naming actual them and putting them in your actual novel, Mr Coupland? Come on now.

*Microserfs* is about the search for meaning, about yearning for purpose in a world becoming saturated with technology. Programmers, coders, testers — they've got hip jobs and eye-watering pay at one of the biggest names in tech, but Daniel and his friends are rapidly heading nowhere however hard they work. Bored and desperately frustrated, something's got to give.

Don't believe me? Well, turn to page 15 (Sunday) — not even out of the first chapter.

> Actually, I've been thinking about this death denial business quite a bit recently. September always makes me think of Jed.
> …
> &nbsp; &nbsp; I'd like to hope Jed is happy in the afterworld, but because I was raised without any beliefs, I have no picture of an afterworld for myself.
> …
> &nbsp; &nbsp; Over the last few weeks I've been oh-so-casually asking the people I know about their own pictures of the afterworld. I can't simply come right out and ask directly because, as I say, you just don't discuss death at Microsoft.

Coming out with the big ones, already — death, and what's beyond it. Douglas, come on — really?
