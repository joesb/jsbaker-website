Well, Douglas Coupland's *Microserfs* — it's a groundbreaking novel about a particular period in time, but it's kinda disappeared into history. So, what's it like reading it today?

Beginning at Chapter 1:

> **FRIDAY, Early Fall, 1993**{.h3-style .secondary-font}
> {.margin-block-end-nil}
>
> This morning, just after 11:00, Michael locked himself in his office and he won't come out.
> {.margin-block-start-nil}
> {.bq-alt}

Stop it. Douglas Coupland, just stop it.

Getting us hooked in just one sentence. Stop it, now.

> Bill (Bill!) sent Michael this totally wicked flame-mail from hell on the email system — and he just wailed on a chunk of code Michael had written.
> {.bq-alt}

Oh, come on. You're referencing Bill Gates? That Bill? So you're setting this in the real world? With actual people in reality as people in the novel?

> We figured it must have been a random quality check to keep the troops in line. Bill's so smart.
> &nbsp; Bill is wise.
> &nbsp; Bill is kind.
> &nbsp; Bill is benevolent.
> &nbsp; Bill, Be My Friend … *Please!*
> {.bq-alt}

Actual Mr B. Gates? Come on, now.
