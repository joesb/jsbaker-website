I am a writer. I write both as part of my work and for personal projects.

My **personal writing** is mostly fiction and other creative writing projects. I've written a number of short stories, some of which you'll [find on here](/writing/). I'm currently working on a novel, a family saga set over three generations across the Twentieth Century.

For my **work writing**, I [write non-fiction](https://www.convivio.com/about-us/joebaker/){rel=noreferrer target=_blank}, mostly on topics related to business and current affairs to support agency leaders in their leadership role. With decades of experience of digital agencies, I bring research skills from 10 years in academia, digesting a wide range of information and analysing sources for the key insights relevant for agency leaders.

I have a **doctorate in religion and narrative from Bristol University**. My research focuses on narratology, specifically Paul Ricoeur's theory of narrative and narrative figuration, and how we use stories to understand ourselves and our place in the world. Stories shape us, and the narrative competence we develop through our exposure to stories determines the way we view the world. I have published large parts of my PhD thesis online at [Figuration.al](https://figuration.al/){rel=noreferrer target=_blank}, in particular the theory section about narrative figuration.
