I'm not a very fast reader at all, but still I managed to read 48 books in 2025 (my original aim target 30, so maybe low-balling it a bit, eh). Below are my favourites, in both fiction and non-fiction … plus the others as well.

I keep track of my reading on [The StoryGraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/){target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"} — a very nice independent alternative to GoodReads. You can find me over there at [@joesb](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/joesb){target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

StoryGraph's summary of [my reading year for 2025](https://app.thestorygraph.com/wrap-up/2025/joesb){target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"}:

> You lingered over quieter, thoughtful moments, felt every heartbeat on the page, and wandered through tales tinged with shadow.
>
> A steady rhythm of stories kept the year moving along nicely.

How poetic.
