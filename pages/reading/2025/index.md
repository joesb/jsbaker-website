          title: Seascraper
          author: Benjamin Wood
          urls:
            book: https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/72af4326-8e4f-4246-b881-b5f8d9c4854b
            cover: /static/images/source/books/wood-banjamin-seascraper.jpeg
          text: |
            A wonderfully quiet novel, with an deep and intimate focus on Thomas, a shanker who trawls the gloomy beach for shrimp in north-west England, all the while holding onto a powerful and personal dream as a folk musician and liberty from what seems like an inevitable future.

          title: The Riders
          author: Tim Winton
          urls:
            book: https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/0f6d68d3-7130-45f5-ab68-c7b36804ae90
            cover: /static/images/source/books/winton-tim-the-riders.jpeg
          text: |
            My first Tim Winton novel, and an excellent place to start. A propulsive, tormenting premise keeps the deep characters and emotional starkness moving forward. Confusion escalates from bewilderment through despair to its final resting place, compounded by utter exhaustion. A great, great story.

          title: Brave New World
          author: Aldous Huxley
          urls:
            book: https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/45947f0b-aaf0-4d48-be85-e0203f878609
            cover: /static/images/source/books/huxley-brave-new-world.jpeg
          text: |
            A powerfully prescient novel for the times we're living in, a vision of a dystopia where we're 'amusing ourselves to death' (to quote the title of [Neil Postman's seminal book on society in the age of mass media](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/cf788eaf-6d4d-4637-bec5-35239da2e849){rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank}, which I also read this year). The story is maybe showing its age a little, but it's still profound and incredibly potent. I'm very glad to have read it, slightly ashamed I haven't previously.

          title: The Great Gatsby
          author: F. Scott Fitzgerald
          urls:
            book: https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/6d399147-7d25-4321-8c6b-c8ff853f04ad
            cover: /static/images/source/books/fitzgerald-the-great-gatsby.jpeg
          text: |
            Another incredibly timely read. Fitzgerald was only 28 when he wrote *Gatsby*, his exquisite story of the 'careless people' of America in the Jazz Age — the echoes for the techbros and oligarchs of our modern times are deep and challenging.

          title: James
          author: Percival Everett
          urls:
            book: https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/7605100d-ba9e-4219-8e44-9d0b11f348bf
            cover: /static/images/source/books/everett-james.jpeg
          text: |
            I've not read *Huckleberry Finn* (I know!), but this retelling of the story from the point of view of enslaved Jim is excellent, following his quest for self-liberation and the irony of the many things and ways he hides.

          title: "Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945"
          author: Tony Judt
          urls:
            book: https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/3cc737ce-c073-4bf6-aaff-1deecb223ba6
            cover: /static/images/source/books/judt-postwar.jpeg
          text: |
            Truly life-changing. Judt paints a huge view of the currents and counter-currents that have shaped Europe since the end of World War 2 — and it's brilliant. My understanding of the current place and time in history on this continent (and the wider world) will never be the same.

          title: "Enshittification: Why Everything Suddenly Got Worse and What to Do About It"
          author: Cory Doctorow
          urls:
            book: https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/7e000e4a-5c89-47a8-93bc-80b5187ac4ec
            cover: /static/images/source/books/doctorow-enshittification.jpeg
          text: |
            Cory Doctorow is a superb tech journalist and communicator, but with the term 'enshittification' he has put his finger on a pungent force shaping our modern life. But it's more than that — it's also a hopeful view of what to do now that everything is so quickly going to shit.

          title: On Friendship
          author: Andrew O'Hagan
          urls:
            book: https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/9ba26358-3a84-4fcf-be54-f1fb45845b8e
            cover: /static/images/source/books/o-hagan-on-friendship.jpeg
          text: |
            A beautiful book of lyrical essays on the many forms of friendship. One of my favourite authors and a master of the essay form gives us a collection of deep reflections and meditations on the yearning for companionship and our need to come together, and how much richer we are because we do.

I'm not a very fast reader at all, but still I managed to read 48 books in 2025 (my original aim target 30, so maybe low-balling it a bit, eh). Below are my favourites, in both fiction and non-fiction … plus the others as well.

I keep track of my reading on [The StoryGraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/){target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"} — a very nice independent alternative to GoodReads. You can find me over there at [@joesb](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/joesb){target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

StoryGraph's summary of [my reading year for 2025](https://app.thestorygraph.com/wrap-up/2025/joesb){target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"}:

> You lingered over quieter, thoughtful moments, felt every heartbeat on the page, and wandered through tales tinged with shadow.
>
> A steady rhythm of stories kept the year moving along nicely.

How poetic.
