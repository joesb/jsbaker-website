It was fine, but not really my thing to be honest. I didn't really buy several aspects of the story, just a bit to implausible for me. But it was fine.

An interesting story of a family in three eras — one in the era of the Crimean War, and then two in much more recent times. Nice language, particularly in the first part, and the story in each of the three parts was engaging.

### [Spring](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/30c0d188-4e13-4b0f-968c-b823cfd6e3b8){rel=noopener target=_blank} <small>(Seasonal Quartet #3)</small>

Another cracking story by Ali Smith, part 3 of her Seasonal Quartet, and the 2nd of the quartet that I've read so far. *Spring* explores the asymlum and immigration system in modern Britain, particularly the experience and use of detention centres. Smith's writing and use of language is superb, and *Spring* has a lovely dimension of magical realism to it that gives a special flavour.

*Autumn* is my favourite of the quartet so far, but both I've read have been great.
