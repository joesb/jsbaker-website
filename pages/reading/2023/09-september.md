2.75 ⭐️

*emotional; informative; reflective; sad; slow-paced*

- **Plot- or character-driven?** Character
- **Strong character development?** It's complicated
- **Loveable characters?** It's complicated
- **Diverse cast of characters?** Yes
- **Flaws of characters a main focus?** Yes

*The Inheritance of Loss* won the 2006 Booker. I've had it in my TBR pile for ages, and then a friend said he'd read it and ejoyed it so much he'd started over again immediately. So I thought I'd read it as well. Meh. It explores colonialsm, especially attentive to identity in post-colonial experience … but without much of any real consequence or connection happening. Meh.

4.75 ⭐️

*adventurous; challenging; informative; inspiring; medium-paced*

This book is the summary of Tim Spector's years of medical science research on food, nutrition and human health. It's brilliant, and it's really helped me (along with the [Zoe](https://zoe.com/){rel=noopener target=_blank} programme ) make huge improvements in my diet and overall health. I recommend it highly.

1.5 ⭐️

*emotional; slow-paced*

- **Plot- or character-driven?** A mix
- **Strong character development?** It's complicated
- **Loveable characters?** No
- **Diverse cast of characters?** It's complicated
- **Flaws of characters a main focus?** No

I bought this as an audiobook to listen on the long journey to our summer holiday. It was a feat of endurance just to get through it. Maybe I'm just not the target audience — I understand there's a film being made.

3.75 ⭐️

*challenging; dark; emotional; funny; tense; medium-paced*

- **Plot- or character-driven?** Plot
- **Strong character development?** It's complicated
- **Loveable characters?** It's complicated
- **Diverse cast of characters?** It's complicated
- **Flaws of characters a main focus?** Yes

This is a really good, fun read, full of twists. *The Bee Sting* follows simultaneous events in the lives of all four members of one family, two parents and two teenage children, and it's multi-perspective view of the same things portrays brilliantly how we understand and misunderstand each other. It's been shortlisted for the 2023 Booker. For me, it's a great read but doesn't quite challenge the boundaries of narrative or of the way we see the world.
