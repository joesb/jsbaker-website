What a cracking book. The siblings of a large family are brought back under the same Dublin roof for the funeral of one of the younger members, a brother, Liam. As the closest sister travels to Brighton to repatriate her brother's body, the novel mostly tells the story about the family's early life and what drove Liam to take his life.

It's a beautiful and painful story told in beautiful and unflinching language. I really enjoyed this book.
