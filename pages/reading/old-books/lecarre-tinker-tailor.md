Yeah, sure, there’s loads of new books and all, but do you ever read old books?
Have you ever read Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy by John le Carré?

Here’s how it starts, the opening sentence …

> The truth is, if old Major Dover hadn’t dropped dead at Taunton races Jim would never have come to Thursgood’s at all.

Come on, John, that’s not fair.

How can you start like that and get us hooked from the very beginning? You’re having a laugh. You’re laughing at us. From the first sentence.

We have questions:

- Who is Major Dover?
- And why’s he dropped dead?

Even before we were ready, even before we were paying attention, he’s gone, shuffled off this mortal coil. Dead, before we even had a chance to draw breath ourselves.

And more:

- Who on Earth is Jim?
- And where is Thursgood's?

Nothing but confusion, from the start … and we're hooked! That's the way to do it. That's the way to write stuff.
