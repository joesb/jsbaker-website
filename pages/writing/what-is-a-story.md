We're pretty good at identifying stories, noticing that something looks like a story, sounds like a story. Sometimes it's obvious — a magazine article, or a movie, say, or maybe we pick up a novel. Stories, right. Cinch.

Othertimes, we work it out from the context — someone's recounting a moment from their childhood or telling you about something odd that happened on the way home from work, for example. We know they're stories without ever being told, 'once upon a time,' or even, 'in a galaxy far, far away.'

But what is it that makes a story? Well, here's an interesting place to start.

Towards the beginning of his book on creative writing, *A Swim in a Pond in the Rain*, George Saunders says:

> A story is a linear-temporal phenomenon. It proceeds, and charms us (or doesn’t), a line at a time.
> 
> <span class="small">George Saunders, *A Swim in a Pond in the Rain*, Bloomsbury Publishing, pg. 11</span>

The quote is taken from a section where Saunders is looking at what makes a reader keep reading (the next sentence goes: "We have to keep being pulled into a story in order for it to do anything to us."), and he develops the 'linear-temporal phenomenon' idea more later on in the book. However, this is an important first step for understanding what distinguishes a story from any other form of speech or writing:

A story is a sequence of things that happen, one after another.{.tab .large}

The same is true of most artforms, of course, a piece of music, an encounter with an artwork in a gallery, and so on.

A story is more than just that, just a sequence of things that happen, though. There's a couple of elements occuring here the same time in a story.

## A selection of things{.h3-style}

**First**, in a story the set of things that happen have been selected.

In the timeline of the story, the linear-temporal phenomenon, as Saunders would have it, many other things happened. Indeed many other things did happen, we just don't know about them — they're not included in the story. The author of the story chose not to include them, for some reason.

Those things are left out because, one way or another, they're not relevant. Cleaning teeth. Folding down boxes for the recycling. Mowing the lawn. Having left-overs for lunch. Noticing a blackbird mimicking a car alarm. They're too boring, probably, or too inconsequential, too tangential or surreal, or maybe even they're too irritating and prevent the story from getting where it's going. Whatever the reason, they're left out.

That's a vital insight, though:

**A story undergoes a process of selection**, a filtering that determines what's 'in' the story and what's 'out'.{.tab}

That's important for both authors and readers:

- *As an author*, you're making choices about what events need to be recounted in the story you're telling, about what's significant (or not) in the lives and times of the characters who experience those events.
- *As a reader*, the specific set of things you're presented with are given to you as the things you should know about — this is what matters, these are the things that are relevant, and the other stuff has been left out because they don't matter. 
  - **Note:** As a reader, you can't (ordinarily) ask the author for clarifications — the author is just a dimension of the text as far as the reader is concerned, and all you've got to go with is the story itself.{.small}

So, as either a writer or a reader, for each story you should be thinkging: in this story, *these are the things that matter*. Forget the other stuff. In other words, if those events are _not_ left out (a character mowing the lawn, having left-overs for lunch, noticing a blackbird mimicking a car alarm, etc.) then *they're important for the story* — they're significant, somehow, for some reason.

## Meaningful action{.h3-style}

**Second**, in a story the sequence of things have a connection between them.

A story not just a random collection of events put into an order of some kind. The story's events have been selected for a reason, for the way that they are connected to each other.
