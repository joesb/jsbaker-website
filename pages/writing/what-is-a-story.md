We're pretty good at noticing stories. Sometimes it's easy — a magazine article, or a movie, say, or maybe we pick up a novel. Othertimes, we get it from the context — someone's recounting a moment from their childhood or telling you about something odd that happened on the way home from work, for example. We know they're stories without ever being told, 'once upon a time,' or even, 'in a galaxy far, far away.'

But what is it that makes a story? Here's an interesting place to start.

Towards the beginning of his book on creative writing, *A Swim in a Pond in the Rain*, George Saunders says:

> A story is a linear-temporal phenomenon. It proceeds, and charms us (or doesn’t), a line at a time.
> 
> <small>George Saunders, *A Swim in a Pond in the Rain*, Bloomsbury Publishing, pg. 11</small>

That quote is taken from a section where Saunders is looking at what makes a reader keep reading (the next sentence goes: "We have to keep being pulled into a story in order for it to do anything to us."). But this is an important first step for understanding what distinguishes a story from any other form of speech or writing:

A story is a sequence of things that happen, one after another.{.tab}

The same is true of most artforms, of course, a piece of music, an encounter with a painting in a gallery. 

A story is more than just that, just a sequence of things that happen, though. Several things are happening at the same time in a story.

**First**, in a story the set of things that happen have been selected. In the timeline of the story, the linear-temporal phenomenon, as Saunders would have it, many other things happened. Indeed many other things did happen, we just don't know about them — they're not included in the story. The author of the story chose not to include them, for some reason.

Those things are left out because, one way or another, they're not relevant. They're too boring, probably, or too inconsequential, too tangential or surreal, or maybe even they're too irritating and prevent the story from getting where it's going. Whatever the reason, they're left out.

That's a significant insight, though.

A story has to undergo a process of selection, a filtering that determines what's 'in' the story and what's 'out'. 

- *As an author*, you are making choices about what events need to be told in the story you're telling, about what's significant (or not) in the life and times of the characters in your story.
- *As a reader*, the specific set of things you're presented with are given to you as the things you should know about — this is what matters, these are the things that are relevant, and the other stuff has been left out because they don't matter. You can't ask the author for clarifications, and all you have is the story at hand. (Ok, maybe sometimes you can, at a reading, book signing, a special screening, etc. But that's kinda it.)

So, as either a writer or a reader, for each story you should be thinkging: in this story, *these are the things that matter*. Forget the other stuff.

**Second**, in a story the sequence of things have a connection between them. They're not just a random collection
