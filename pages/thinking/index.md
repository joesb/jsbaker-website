Notes, articles and essays on themes and topics that shape my writing. My doctoral studies in narratology have informed much of my thinking about language, literature, and what it means to be human.

--You can find large parts of my doctoral thesis, particularly about theories of narrative, at [Figuration.al](https://figuration.al/){rel=noreferrer target=_blank .light}.--
