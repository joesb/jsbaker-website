  The universe is vast and baffling and we are insignificant specs within it.
  
  So why haven't we all gone mad?

It's the most amazing thing that so few of us are out of our minds.{.large .bold}

How do we manage to stay sane?{.large .margin-block-end-lg}

The world that we all live in is utterly vast. Take the country. Let's just start there. Millions of people! And you're just one of those.

Scale that up to the continent, to the world — there's [8.3 billion people currently living on Planet Earth](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/){target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener"}, at the start of 2026. 8.3 billion! Bonkers.

And this planet we're on — that's tiny, too. Have you seen the pale blue dot photo?

{% ImgFigure "NASA's [pale blue dot image](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/voyager/voyager-1s-pale-blue-dot){target=_blank rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"} of Earth taken beyond Neptune, 6 billion kilometres out from the Sun.", classes.figClasses %}
!["Earth as a pale blue dot in the universe"](/static/images/source/nasa-pale-blue-dot-revised.jpg)
{% endImgFigure %}

It was taken on Feb. 14, 1990, by NASA’s Voyager 1 spacecraft at the edge of the solar system. Earth is just a point of light, barely one pixel in size, caught in a scattered ray of sunlight.

We are each little individuals walking around on that tiny point of light for the briefest instant of cosmic time. Bananas.

The Universe itself? Well, the [scale of the Universe](https://scaleofuniverse.com/en-gb){target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener"} is just incomprehensible.

Now, think of some names — of people who are generally well-known amongst that 8.3 billion. On a good day we could probably list a hundred or so public figures, maybe even a few more — still that's a vanishingly small portion of the global population, so insignificant it's little more than a rounding error. Those people, those famous names — they're barely a blink.

Think back a bit in your family history. Do you know who your great, great grandparents were? That's your grandparents' grandparents, that's all — not that far back in your lineage, probably sometime around the end of the 1800s, the first part of the 1900s, or thereabouts. Do you know much about them? Do you know anything about them? Do you even know their names? You're directly descended from them — you of all people should be someone who remembers them, even if no one else in that 8.3 billion does. No?

And how about us — *will our great, great grandchildren remember us?*

But this is all just about existing. What about living?

Living as a human is hard.

The world is a bewildering and baffling place, confusing and difficult, a continual experience of triumph and adversity, joy and pain and hope, a place that begins and ends in suffering and surviving.

Tom Junod, author of the famous [*The Falling Man* essay](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a48031/the-falling-man-tom-junod/){target=_blank rel="nofollow noopener"} in Esquire magazine (originally published in the September 2003 issue), [talks powerfully of our tragic fallibility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnHTUyZjwiY&t=3870s){target=_blank rel="nofollow noopener"}. The long epic of human history, he says, tells its own story, a story in which everything humanity does is wrong. We fuck up. We fuck up again, and again, and again. Any piece of technology we get from or put to use in war, and we keep doing it. Our religion, our politics, inevitably becomes a tool of tyranny, he says. We fuck up. We fuck up again, and again, and again.

The same consistent truth governs the personal scale. Relationships between individuals are fraught with difficulties, where so much is confusing or cryptic or impenetrable. We hurt each other, and we are hurt by each other, and we carry on hurting each other.

And yet, we do not despair. Despite all of this, we rarely lose hope. We rise, and we rise again the next day and we get on with living, with moving forward, through the suffering and the confusion and the bewilderment.

Why? And how?

## Entering the Total Perspective Vortex

Douglas Adams's brilliant series *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* includes terrible torture device called *The Total Perspective Vortex*. In the *Hitchhiker's* novels, the Vortex was described in *The Restaurant at the End of the Universe*:

> … when you are put into the Vortex you are given just one momentary glimpse of the entire unimaginable infinity of creation, and somewhere in it a tiny little marker, a microscopic dot on a microscopic dot, which says ‘You are here.’
>
> Douglas Adams, *The Restaurant at the End of the Universe*, pg. 72{.smaller .margin-block-start-none}

Its potency is unimaginable, described briefly by Roosta, who is encountered at The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy editorial building:

> “Listen!” said Roosta urgently. “You can kill a man, destroy his body, break his spirit, but only the Total Perspective Vortex can annihilate a man’s soul! The treatment lasts seconds, but the effects last the rest of your life!”
>
> Douglas Adams, *The Restaurant at the End of the Universe*, pg. 60{.smaller .margin-block-start-none}

Zaphod Beeblebrox, briefly the President of the Galaxy is the only person known to have survived the Total Perspective Vortex.

Because we tell stories.

## Narratives > the universe

Stories are the unique and distinctive power we have over the universe. Stories are an alchemy of two source elements — language, and experience — and they are combined together to resist the implacable, unyielding, remorseless passage of the cosmos, untouched by the to-and-fro of humanity.

Narrated time changes the very structure of the cosmos, and in doing so makes its shape more human.
